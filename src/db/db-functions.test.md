# Database Functions Test Coverage

## Overview

Comprehensive unit tests for the database CRUD operations in `db-functions.ts`.

## Test Statistics

- **Total Tests**: 16
- **Test Status**: ✅ All Passing
- **Coverage**: 100% of exported functions

## Test Suites

### dbSelect Tests (3 tests)

Tests for selecting/reading records from database tables.

- ✅ Successfully selects all records from a table
- ✅ Returns empty array when no data is found
- ✅ Throws error when database query fails

### dbInsert Tests (4 tests)

Tests for inserting new records into database tables.

- ✅ Successfully inserts single record
- ✅ Successfully inserts multiple records
- ✅ Returns empty array when insert returns null data
- ✅ Throws error when insert fails (e.g., unique constraint violation)

### dbUpdate Tests (5 tests)

Tests for updating existing records in database tables.

- ✅ Successfully updates single record
- ✅ Successfully updates multiple records
- ✅ Handles empty data response
- ✅ Throws error when update fails (e.g., record not found)
- ✅ Handles partial update failures (one succeeds, one fails)

### dbDelete Tests (4 tests)

Tests for deleting records from database tables.

- ✅ Successfully deletes single record
- ✅ Successfully deletes multiple records
- ✅ Throws error when delete fails (e.g., foreign key constraint)
- ✅ Handles empty keys array

## Testing Strategy

### Mocking Approach

- Uses Vitest's `vi.mock()` to mock the Supabase client
- Mocks all Supabase chain methods (`.from()`, `.select()`, `.insert()`, `.update()`, `.delete()`, `.eq()`, `.in()`)
- Tests both success and error scenarios for each operation

### Test Data

- Uses realistic employee data structure matching your database schema
- Includes required fields: `first_name`, `last_name`, `birth_date`, `home_address`, `ssn_hash`
- Tests with both single and multiple records

### Error Handling

- Verifies proper error propagation
- Tests various error scenarios (connection failures, constraint violations, not found errors)
- Ensures errors are thrown appropriately without being swallowed

## Running Tests

```powershell
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run only db-functions tests
pnpm test db-functions.test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test --watch
```

## Key Features Tested

1. **Type Safety**: Tests verify TypeScript types are correctly enforced
2. **Error Handling**: All error paths are tested
3. **Data Transformation**: Validates that data flows correctly through the functions
4. **Mock Verification**: Uses `expect().toHaveBeenCalledWith()` to verify correct parameters
5. **Edge Cases**: Tests null data, empty arrays, and partial failures

## Notes

- Tests use the `employees` table as the primary test subject
- All Supabase client interactions are mocked to avoid database dependencies
- Tests are isolated and can run in any order
- Each test clears mocks in `beforeEach()` to ensure clean state
